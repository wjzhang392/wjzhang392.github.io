I am a PhD researcher at [Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering](https://lcsee.statler.wvu.edu/) at West Virginia University, working with [Prof. Nasrabadi](https://ep.jhu.edu/faculty/nasser-nasrabadi/). I obtained my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering at [K.N.T University of Technology](https://en.kntu.ac.ir/), Tehran, Iran.

Research Interests
----

My primary research focuses on 2D computer vision, multi-modal foundation models, unsupervised representation learning, metric learning, generative vision, domain generalization, transfer learning, and adversarial learning. I specialize in areas such as weak-to-strong generalization, un/semi/weakly supervised learning, autoregressive models, dataset distillation, adversarial robustness, biometrics, and discriminative models.
